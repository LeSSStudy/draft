Sprint Planning consists of two parts that boil down to what and how. Sprint Planning One focuses on selection of ready items from those offered by the Product Owner, wrapping up lingering questions, and definition of the Sprint Goal. Sprint Planning Two focuses on creating a plan of work to get to ‘done’ for each item. The items and plan of action or tasks comprise the Sprint Backlog.

## Sprint Planning Overview

In LeSS, Sprint Planning One is a meeting for all of the Teams together where they decide which team will work on which items. Sprint Planning Two is a separate meeting per team where each team creates the plan for getting the items to 'done' during the Sprint.

## Tips for Sprint Planning One

Sprint Planning One is a relatively simple and often short meeting. Some tips for getting it to work well:

* Limit the participants. If there are only two teams, then the whole team can attend. If there are more than two teams, then send one or two representatives per team. (The ScrumMaster should not be the representative.)
* Product Owner presents the highest priority items from the Product Backlog to the team.
* The teams apportion the items amongst themselves.
* Any open questions related to the items (that weren't resolved in earlier [Product Backlog Refinement](product-backlog-refinement.html)) are discussed.
* Discuss the need for coordination between teams during the upcoming sprint and plan for a [Multi-team Sprint Planning Two](sprint-planning-two.html) if needed.
